# Hello, I'm Rahul.

## About Me

My name is Rahul Porel, and I'm a self-driven software developer on a learning journery. I specialize in technologies such as JavaScript, NodeJs, HTML, CSS, SASS, Webpack, Bootstrap and  Firebase. Currently, I am diving into NextJs and ReactJS.

## Approach

As a self-taught developer, I seek to delve deep into every technology I encounter. My approach is centered on crafting solutions that are both simple and clean, even in the face of complex functionalities.
